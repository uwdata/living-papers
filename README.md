# Living Papers

Authoring tools for scholarly communication.
Create interactive web pages or formal research papers from markdown source.
Living Papers is intended to be a "language toolkit" for parsing, transforming, and rendering documents.

To get up and running quickly, use the [Living Papers project template](https://github.com/uwdata/living-papers-template/).

This repo is a research testbed for Living Papers development. There will be bugs. Contributions (issues, PRs, etc) are welcome!

## Setup

### Pre-Requisites

Before working with Living Papers, set up your local environment:

1. Install [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if you don't have them already. We recommend using a node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Node v16.17 or higher is recommended.
2. Install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html). You should be able to run `pandoc` from the command line. A recent version of Pandoc (v2.18 or higher) is recommended.
3. Install other software packages as needed:
  - To use R code blocks, install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) along with the `knitr` package and any other libraries you wish to use.
  - To publish LaTeX / PDF output, install a TeX distribution such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). You should be able to run `pdflatex` and `bibtex` from the command line.

### Usage Instructions

To use Living Papers for a new publishing project, you can install the `@living-papers/cli` npm package, which provides the `lpub` utility to convert source to output documents.

That said, we recommend copying the [project template repo](https://github.com/uwdata/living-papers-template/) for a pre-configured authoring setup.

### Developer Instructions

Clone this monorepo, run `npm install` to install JavaScript dependencies.

Once installed, you can:
- Run `npm run test` to run test cases across monorepo packages.
- Run `npm run lint` to lint source code across monorepo packages.
- Run `npx lpub filename.md` to compile a source file in the current directory.

The [`examples`](https://github.com/uwdata/living-papers/tree/main/examples) folder contains example Living Papers articles. Within the folder for each example, run `npm run build` to produce compiled output article(s).
