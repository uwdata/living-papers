# Introduction

Computers can serve as exciting tools for discovery, with which we can
model and explore complex phenomena. For example, to test theories about
the formation of the universe, we can perform _simulations_ to predict
how galaxies evolve. To do this, we could gather the estimated mass and
location of stars and then model their gravitational interactions over time.

Another avenue for discovery is to _visualize_ complex information to
reveal structure and patterns. Consider this network diagram, showing
connections between people in a social network. We can use such diagrams
to examine community groups and identify people who bridge between them.

Though they may seem quite different at first, these two examples share
a common need: they require computing forces that arise from pairwise
interactions among a set of points, often referred to as an _N-body problem_.
In the case of astronomical simulation, we seek to model the
gravitational forces among stars. In the case of network visualization,
we compute the layout using a similar physical simulation:
nodes in the network act as charged particles that repel each other, while
links act as springs that pull related nodes together.

_To get a sense of how this force-directed layout works, drag the nodes or
use the slider to adjust the force strength._ Negative values indicate
repulsive forces, while positive values indicate attractive forces.

Inputs.range([-30, 10], { step: 1, label: 'Force Strength' })

A straightforward approach to computing N-body forces is to consider all
pairs of individual points and add up the contributions of each
interaction. This na√Øve scheme has _quadratic complexity_: as the number
of points _n_ increases, the running time grows proportionally
to _n_^2^, quickly leading to intractably long calculations.
How might we do better?

# The Barnes-Hut Approximation

To accelerate computation and make large-scale simulations possible, the
astronomers Josh Barnes and Piet Hut devised a clever scheme.
The key idea is to approximate long-range
forces by replacing a group of distant points with their center
of mass. In exchange for a small amount of error,
this scheme significantly speeds up calculation, with
complexity _n log n_ rather than _n_^2^.

Central to this approximation is a _spatial index_: a "map" of space that helps
us model groups of points as a single center of mass. In two dimensions, we can
use a [quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) data structure, which
subdivides square regions of space into four equal-sized quadrants.
(For three dimensions,  an [octree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree)
divides a cubic volume into eight sub-cubes.)

The Barnes-Hut approximation involves three steps:

1. Construct the spatial index (e.g., quadtree)
2. Calculate centers of mass
3. Estimate forces

Let's explore each step in turn. We will assume we are computing _repulsive_
forces for the purposes of network layout. This setup is akin to modeling
anti-gravity or electric forces with similarly-charged particles. While we
will use the term "center of mass", this could readily
be replaced with "center of charge".

_As you read through, click the [action links](`alert('üëç üéâ')`)
to update the diagram!_

## Step 1: Construct the Quadtree

We begin with [a set of two-dimensional input points](`layout=false, step=0`).
When we [insert the first point into the quadtree](`layout=false, step=1`),
it is added to the top-level root cell of the tree.

[When we insert another point](`layout=false, step=2`),
the tree expands by subdiving the space.
With [each subsequent insertion](`layout=false, step=Math.min(step + 1, 77)`),
more fine-grained cells are added until all points reside in their own cell.

_Advance the slider to add each point and produce the full quadtree_.

~~~ js {bind=step}
Inputs.range([0, 77], { step: 1, label: 'Inserted Points' })
~~~

## Step 2: Calculate Centers of Mass

After quadtree construction, [we calculate centers of mass for
each cell of the tree](`layout=false, ++accum`).
The center of mass of a quadtree cell is simply the weighted
average of the centers of its four child cells.

We visit the leaf node cells first and then visit subsequent parent
cells, merging data as we pass upwards through the tree.
Once the traversal completes, each cell has been updated with the
position and strength of its center of mass.

## Step 3: Estimate N-Body Forces

Now we are ready to estimate forces!

[To measure forces at a given point, let's add a "probe" to our
diagram](`theta=0, estimate=true`) (![Probe icon](probe.svg)). The purple
line extending from the probe indicates the direction and magnitude of
the total force at that location. (To promote visibility,
the purple line is three times longer than the actual
pixel distance the probe would be moved in a single timestep of
the force simulation.) The dotted lines extending to the probe
represent the force components exerted by individual points.

_Move the probe (click or drag) to explore the force field_.

Ignoring the quadtree, we can na√Øvely calculate forces by summing the
contributions of _all_ individual points. Of course, we would instead like
to use the quadtree to accelerate calculation and approximate long-range
forces. Rather than compute interactions among individual
points, [we can compute interactions with centers of mass, using smaller
quadtree cells for nearer points and larger cells for more distant
points.](`theta=1, estimate=true`)

At this point we've skipped a critical detail: what constitutes
"long-range" versus "short-range" forces? We consider both
the _distance_ to the center of a quadtree cell and that cell's _width_.
If the ratio _width / distance_ falls below a chosen threshold
-- a parameter Œò (_theta_) -- we treat the quadtree cell as a
source of long-range forces and use its center of mass.
Otherwise, we will recursively visit the child cells in the quadtree.

When Œò = 1, a quadtree cell's center of mass will be used -- and its
internal points ignored -- if the distance from the sample point to the
cell's center is greater than or equal to the cell's width.

_Adjust the Œò parameter to view its effect on force estimation_. How does
the number of considered points change based on the probe location and Œò?
How does the direction and magnitude of the total force vary with Œò?

~~~ js { bind-set=theta }
Inputs.range([0, 2], {
  step: 0.1, label: 'Theta Œò', value: focus < 0 ? -(focus + 1) : focus
})
~~~

We can now perform force estimation for each individual point, using the
Barnes-Hut approximation to limit the total number of comparisons!

# Performance Analysis

To assess the performance of the Barnes-Hut approximation, let's look at
both the running time and accuracy of force estimation. We will compare
na√Øve (_n_^2^) calculation to different settings of the Œò parameter.

We will take measurements using different point sets,
ranging from 500 to 10,000 points. For each point count,
we average the results from 50 separate runs of force estimation,
each time using a different set of points placed at uniformly
random coordinates within a 900 x 500 pixel rectangle.

[:time-plot:]{bind=focus}

The running time results confirm that the Barnes-Hut approximation can
significantly speed-up computation.
As expected, the [na√Øve approach](`focus=0`){.t00} exhibits a quadratic
relationship, whereas increasing the Œò parameter leads to faster
calculations. A low setting of [Œò = 0.5](`focus=0.5`){.t05} does not fare
better than the na√Øve approach until processing about 6,000 points.
Until that point, the overhead of quadtree construction and center of mass
calculation outstrips any gains in force estimation.
In contrast, for [Œò = 1](`focus=1`){.t10} and [Œò = 1.5](`focus=1.5`){.t15}
we see significant improvements in running time.

To evaluate approximation error, we measure the average vector
distance between the results of the na√Øve scheme and Barnes-Hut.
In the context of a force-directed graph layout, this error
represents the difference (in pixels) between node positions after
applying the na√Øve and approximate methods.

[:error-plot:]{bind=focus}

Looking at the error results, we first see that the average error is
relatively small: only ~5% of a single pixel in difference! However, we should
take care in interpreting these results, as we use the _average_ error per
point and the _maximum_ error may be substantially higher.
While [Œò = 1](`focus=1`){.t10} and [Œò = 1.5](`focus=1.5`){.t15} exhibit
similar _running times_, here we see notably higher _error rates_ for
[Œò = 1.5](`focus=1.5`){.t15} versus [Œò = 1](`focus=1`){.t10}
and [Œò = 0.5](`focus=0.5`){.t05}.

These results suggest that a good default value for Œò -- with low
running time _and_ low approximation error -- is around 1.0.
Indeed, in practice it is common to see default settings slightly below 1.
In visualization applications, where errors on the order of a few pixels
are not a problem, even higher Œò values may be used without issue.

# Conclusion

The Barnes-Hut approximation has had a major impact on both physical
simulation and network visualization, enabling n-body calculations
to scale to much larger data sets than na√Øve force calculation permits.

[Returning to our initial network diagram](`step=77, estimate=false, layout=true`),
we can use Barnes-Hut to efficiently compute repulsive forces at each timestep.
For each animation frame, we perform the approximation anew, creating a new
quadtree, accumulating centers of mass, and (approximately) estimating forces.
