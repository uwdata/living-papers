An article with Python code evaluated live in the browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/). Python code cells participate in the same reactive runtime as JavaScript code cells.

Run `npm run build` to compile the article.

This example demonstrates:

- Evaluation of Python code live in the browser
- Integration of Python objects in the JavaScript reactive runtime
