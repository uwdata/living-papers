% This is very much like "diamondrule.eps", but simpler, shorter, better
% centered, and slightly thinner.  Unlike in the original "diamondrule.eps":
% * Diamond is made of circular arcs (with no rounding at the tips)
% * Diamond is centered between the two lines
% * The two lines are centered vertically
% * The BoundingBox and HiResBoundingBox are equal. The original
%   HiResBoundingBox was 0 0 212.9981 12.2764
% * The vertical height was decreased from 13 to 12 points, in recognition
%   of what the height was in the original HiResBoundingBox (12.2764).
