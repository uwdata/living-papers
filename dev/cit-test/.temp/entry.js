This style of interactive media has the potential to engage a large audience and more clearly explain concepts, but is expensive and time consuming to produce. Drawing on industry experience and interviews with domain experts, we contribute design tools to make it easier to author and publish interactive articles. We introduce Idyll, a novel \"compile-to-the-web\" language for web-based interactive narratives. Idyll implements a flexible article model, allowing authors control over document style and layout, reader-driven events (such as button clicks and scroll triggers), and a structured interface to JavaScript components. Through both examples and first-use results from undergraduate computer science students, we show how Idyll reduces the amount of effort and custom code required to create interactive articles.","tldr":"This work introduces Idyll, a novel \"compile-to-the-web\" language for web-based interactive narratives, and shows how Idyll reduces the amount of effort and custom code required to create interactive articles."},{"id":"Jones:1983","doi":"10.1080/00949658308810650","s2id":"22cd4524838f5e06b809374b6bca24ba947b1607","year":1983,"author":[{"given":"M.

Several questions arising from this multivariate extension are addressed. The choice of binning rule is discussed, and it is demonstrated that linear binning leads to substantial accuracy improvements over simple binning. An investigation into the most appropriate means of computing the multivariate discrete convolutions required for binned kernel estimators is also given. The results of an empirical study indicate that, in multivariate settings, the fast Fourier transform offers considerable time savings compared to direct calculation of convolutions."},{"id":"Wells:1986","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767776","s2id":"305b55e2fef5679878313933c1bf4ee0251ce53c","year":1986,"author":[{"given":"W.

In this paper we discuss the background of Gaussian filtering and look at some methods for implementing it. Consideration of the central limit theorem suggests using a cascade of ``simple'' filters as a means of computing Gaussian filters. Among ``simple'' filters, uniform-coefficient finite-impulse-response digital filters are especially economical to implement. The idea of cascaded uniform filters has been around for a while [13], [16]. We show that this method is economical to implement, has good filtering characteristics, and is appropriate for hardware implementation. We point out an equivalence to one of Burt's methods [1], [3] under certain circumstances. As an extension, we describe an approach to implementing a Gaussian Pyramid which requires approximately two addition operations per pixel, per level, per dimension. We examine tradeoffs in choosing an algorithm for Gaussian filtering, and finally discuss an implementation.","tldr":"This paper describes an approach to implementing a Gaussian Pyramid which requires approximately two addition operations per pixel, per level, per dimension, and examines tradeoffs in choosing an algorithm for Gaussian filtering."}]);
