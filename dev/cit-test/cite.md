Did you read @Scott:1985? It was part of the reading list [@Scott:1985; @Jones:1983; @Silverman:1982; @Wand:1994; @Wells:1986].

I liked @doi:10.1145/3242587.3242600, which should be the same as [@s2id:4fca64e6dc4e803d3ed904c04c6845a9e6adc53e] and [@s2id:52037222].

We should also handle unresolved citations [@badcite].
